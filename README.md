Student Profile Web Page

Lab Assignment 02 - Web Technologies and Platforms

📌 Project Description

This project is a Student Profile Web Page designed to demonstrate the fundamental usage of HTML structure and CSS selectors. It separates content (HTML) from presentation (CSS) and adheres to strict assignment constraints (no Flexbox, Grid, or JavaScript).

🛠 Technologies Used

HTML5: Used semantic elements (header, main, section, footer).

CSS3: Used an external stylesheet (style.css).

Editor: VS Code.

📋 Features & Selector Usage

As per the lab requirements, the following CSS selectors were implemented:

Universal Selector: Used to reset default margins and padding.

Element Selectors: Applied to h1 and p tags.

Class Selectors: .section-box used for section styling.

ID Selectors: #student-name used to highlight the name.

Group Selectors: Shared styles applied to h2 and h3.

Descendant Selectors: Used for specific list items in Courses and Hobbies.
